       Today is a very special day! It's my birthday!!! AWW YAA!!!
       And tomorrow it's my birthday party. I will post pictures so BEWARE...
       It was a very nice birthday, all of my classes for some reason it was
       really easy! Then I went to advisory and we ate the cupcakes that I
       made for them! They were normal cupcakes with vanilla frosting that
       had a green tip, and we had rainbow sprinkles on! The frosting is more
       then I usually do. The day before, Michelle Ahn gave me 2 IPhone 5
       cases and 6 home button stickers. It was AWESOME because it was rainbow!!!

       It's almost CHRISTMAS!!! And it is also 4 days until school ends!!!
       A few more days and "Hello Australia~!" I can't wait to go!!! I might
       be able to even go sky-diving!!! When I go to Australia, I really want
       to take surf lessons. It seems really fun, besides the fact a shark
       might come and eat you . . . .

       Today, I had Thanksgiving dinner!!!!!! I was so GOOD!!!!!! I had to
       help with all the cooking, we made mashed potatoes, gravt, cranberry
       sauce, corn bread, a turkey, pumpkin pie, and more!!! Later in the day,
       Emily Waurer, my friend, came over for a sleepover, and a few minutes
       later some other families came over. Emily and I ate and made some
       traditional German pointy star thing out of origami paper. I will post
       a picture down here. We watched "Author's Christmas" and also
       "Spy Kids 4." We slept at 11:00 pm and woke up at 8:30 am. Emily at
       jam, butter, cream cheese, and a piece of bread and I at a bagel.
       Later she left., and thats what I did for Thanksgiving!!!
